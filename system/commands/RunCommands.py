# This command can be used in key bindings to run multiple commands, it
# expects a single argument “commands” containing the list of commands to
# run.
#
# Each command have 3 properties:
#
#     * “command”: The actual command to run;
#     * “on”: Where the command will run, it accepts: app, window and view; If
#       no value is specified, the default one “view” will be used;
#     * “args”: Arguments to pass directly to the command;
#
# There’s an example in:
